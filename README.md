## UBHacking 2020!
***Team Name: SurveyCorps***<br> 
<p align= "Justify">
We are very excited to participate in the UB Hacking contest organized virtually this year. As part of this hackathon, our team decided to design and develop a Full Stack social media application where users can register themselves, follow their friends, post pics or messages, like and comment on the posts etc.
During this event, developing an application like this has helped us to gain knowledge of end-to-end application development in constrained time duration. 
We are very excited to submit and show our application to the event judges.
